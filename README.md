# InternetVin Terminal

An embedded terminal for Obsidian with multi-tab support, wiki-link autocomplete, and drag-and-drop file paths.

## Features

- **Real PTY terminal** - Full zsh shell running in a real pseudo-terminal, not a basic command runner
- **Multi-tab support** - Open multiple terminal sessions with named tabs
- **Wiki-link autocomplete** - Type `[[` to get an autocomplete dropdown of your vault notes, just like in the editor
- **Drag and drop** - Drag files from Finder or Obsidian's file explorer into the terminal to paste their paths
- **Screenshot drop** - Drag macOS screenshot thumbnails directly into the terminal (saves to a temp file and pastes the path)
- **Fullscreen mode** - Expand the terminal to fill the entire Obsidian window
- **Session persistence** - Tab names and layout are saved across restarts
- **Keyboard passthrough** - All keystrokes go to the terminal. Cmd+key combos still work for Obsidian shortcuts
